  <h1>ABOUT</h1>
  <h2>A Paradox</h2>
      <p>From the outside looking in, one might see my life as a paradox. From being a social
    science major at an engineering school to being a 5'2" athlete on a sports team
    that essentially requires height (volleyball), and everything in between, my life has
    been full of these seemingly conflicting characteristics. However, I've been able to
    extract meaning from a life of contradiction and balance...and I highly recommend it!</p>
  <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>Being a psychology major at a technology school has been one of the most rewarding
      experiences during my time as a student. After an attempt to minor in biology
      freshman year (and barely passing Genetics), I realized that I shouldn't ever force my brain
      to completely rewire itself just to do what everyone else is doing. I didn't need to
      minor in science to prove my worth.<br />Instead, I filled my free electives with classes
      I actually enjoyed. I took multiple philosophy courses where I learned all about
      artificial intelligence. Through my business courses, I learned about why people
      empathize with particular brands and how companies use that knowledge in order to
      advance their visions. While sitting in my architecture lectures, I realized the
      impact of physical space on our emotional experiences. In my Science and Technology
      class, my professor taught us how to think critically about existing
      technologies and how they are often formed based on social categorizations.
      <br />It wasn't until the end of my undergraduate career that I started to see how everything connects to the
      human experience. By taking classes that were challenging enough for me to feel enjoyment and
      growth at the same time, I was able to realize my potential. I know now that I want to be a
      an impactful social scientist in an evolving technological world.</p>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>I want to bring what I know, or what I think I know, about the human experience
      to the intersecting worlds of design, technology, and innovation.</p>
