  <h1><b>Psychology Majors Shouldn't Try to Code</b></h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my Single-Page Web Presence Project! As part of my COM 380 course, I
        am supposed to create a web page for myself from scratch. Is it easy? Pfff.
        Nope. Trying to expand your horizons takes a lot of stretching of the brain,
        especially when you've been taught to think, learn, and create a certain way. One
        day, maybe not today or tomorrow, I'll be able to do this like the back of my hand.
        But alas, this is what I've got so far.
