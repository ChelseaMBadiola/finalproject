    <h2><b>About me</b></h2>
        <p>
          As a psychology major at a technical school, I'm fascinated with human behavior
          as it relates to interactions with technology. Because of this, I'd love to
          pursue a career in human-computer interaction and user experience design.

          When I'm not cramming to write a 10-page research paper on a Sunday night, you can find me
          <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chelsea-badiola">songwriting</a>, exploring Chicago,
          or playing volleyball.
